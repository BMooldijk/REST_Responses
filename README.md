# REST_Responses
Takes the hassle away of setting up your HTTPResponse objects in microflows

## How to use
The best way to get started is to look at an example.
An example can be found in the example folder in the module. It contains a microflow with several http response microflow actions.

To get the example to work you simply need to:
- copy the example folder to a custom module 
- include all contents into your project
- send request to the endpoint of the example published rest service
